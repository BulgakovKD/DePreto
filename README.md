- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, My name is Konstantin. Lately I have worked closely with the following technologies stack: Apache Airflow,
PostgreSQL, Alembic, Docker, Pytest. In parallel, for educational purposes, I studied documentation and worked with:
Fastapi, Pydantic, SQLAlchemy, Hadoop ecosystem (HDFS, MapReduce, Hive, Spark, etc.)

- ðŸŒ± At the beginning of 2021 I decided to leave the environmental field and to develop in the IT. To date, a course on the
basics of programming from Geekbrains was taken, which resulted in the development of a personal page using the
markup language HTML and JS (https://github.com/DePreto/first_website).
Since April 2021 I'm taking a one year course "Python Developer Profession" to get the corresponding knowledge
base and diploma. I developed a telegram bot for hotel search (https://github.com/DePreto/tg_bot) and took a Python
Advanced course with the preparation of the diploma project on API development on FastAPI - Twitter's analog (in
development). 
Also, you can look on my testing tasks in /test_api and /testing_tasks reps.
In January 2022, got a job as a Junior in the development department, which deals with batch processing of large
amounts of data, from scientific equipment, on their own computing cluster.
